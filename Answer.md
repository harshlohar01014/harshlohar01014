1.1 The "Product" entity has a field called "category_id," which acts as a foreign key. This means it references the "Product_Category" entity. In simpler terms, each product is assigned to a category, and this connection is established through the "category_id" field, which points to the corresponding category in the "Product_Category" entity. So, a product belongs to a specific category, and this relationship is maintained through the foreign key.
